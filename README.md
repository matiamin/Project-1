# Project-1

# As a user, my opponent and I should be able to enter our names so that we can start the game.

# As users, my opponent and I should each be given half of the cards with randomly assigned values so that we can play a fair game.

# As users, whose ever card is higher in value after a click should win the cards so that we can eventually end the game and know the winner.

# As a user, two clicked cards that are equal in value should be a tie so that we can move on to the next click.

# As users, we should be able to reset the game so that we can play other players.
