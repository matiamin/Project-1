# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is well scoped, and your user stories are
pretty good. (I did make some suggestions as comments in your readme, but they
really are a good start as is.)

Good job making many commits!

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Great job! Your app is fully-featured (I like the
fact that each question has multiple potential correct answers). I noticed no
major bugs when using your app as well.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Your code is well-designed in terms of how you solved
the problem, and how you modeled your data. My main suggestions are:
1. to focus on breaking code out into smaller functions that you call when
needed. e.g.: `checkAnswer(question, given_answer)`, etc.
2. Focus on better use of indentation and white space for readability

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Not a lot to add here... you solved the problem well
and simply!
